function x = backsub(U,y)
%BackSub Summary of this function goes here
% The part of the procedure to use LU decomposition to find x
% As Ax = b is the same as LUx = b
% We let Ux = y here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
%   parameters
%   U: the upper triangular matrix from LU decomposition
%   y: the right hand side of the equation
%   Output:
%   x: the solution
n = length(U);

for i = n:-1:1
    for j = n:-1:i+1
        sum
    end
